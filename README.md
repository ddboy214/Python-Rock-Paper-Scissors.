# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview

This is a basic implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game lets the player compete against the computer with randomly generated choices.

## Features

- Command-line interface
- Validates player input
- Random computer choices
- Displays results of the game

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddboy214/Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors.git
```

3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

```bash
cd Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors
```

## Usage

To play the game, run the script using Python:

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

You will be prompted to choose one of `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`. The computer will make a random choice, and the result of the game will be displayed.

## Example

```
Choose one (rock, paper, scissors): rock
You win! The computer chose scissors.
```

## Code Explanation

- **Player Choice:** The player is prompted to enter their choice. Input is converted to uppercase for consistency.
- **Choices List:** A list of valid choices (`rock`, `paper`, `scissors`) is defined.
- **Input Validation:** The script checks if the player’s choice is valid.
- **Random Computer Choice:** The computer’s choice is randomly selected from the choices list.
- **Game Logic:** The result is determined based on the player’s and computer’s choices, with outcomes of win, draw, or invalid input being displayed.
